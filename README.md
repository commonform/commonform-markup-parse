Parse Common Form markup, returning an object containing a form and
an array of path-to-blank mappings.

```javascript
var parse = require('commonform-markup-parse')
parse(stringOfMarkup); // => {form: Object, directions: Array}
```

The parser is made of several components:

1. a hand-coded context-tracking tokenizer (or lexer) that emits
   tokens for indentation and outdentation, in addition to content tokens

2. an LALR(1) parser generated by [Jison] from a Bison-like BNF grammar

3. [commonform-fix-strings] to convert the parser's AST to a valid
   common form by fixing various string-related validation issues,
   like extra space

4. a tiny algorithm that removes the hints text from fill-in-the-blanks
   within the form, and emits path-to-hint mappings instead

The parser passes the [commonform-markup-tests] test suite.

If you'd like to write a parser in a different language, the test
suite and this package are best places to start.  Your language
probably already has a Bison clone or a BNF-compatible parser
combinators library.
